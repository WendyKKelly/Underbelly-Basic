## Distancing

Grief is the experience of loss. Loss from death of a loved one, loss from the transformation from married person to single, loss from giving up an old way of life for a new one.
A large percentage of the world’s population is participating in social distancing. Many of us have travel restrictions imposed, for others, bars and restaurants have been closed. Schools have been closed, we are being asked not to see or get close to our friends. There are stories of loved ones dying alone in the hospital because of quarantine restrictions.
We are grieving. Whether we grieve our old routines, the loss of income, the loss of meaning that comes from work or the loss of a person who succumbed to Covid-19, we are grieving.

## Grief Shows Up Uninvited — Welcome It

I think it’s fair to feel lots of feelings around this kind of grief. I know I struggle with feelings of guilt almost daily when I recognize that I am grieving a little and then wonder at how, in my privilege, I can have the audacity to grieve.
So. It might be helpful to remember that feelings come and go and we really can’t do much about their flitting into our lives uninvited as they do. The little darlings — if we can, perhaps picture them as little clouds, or little leaves, or, as I am wont to do, as little elfin sprites, mucking around in my life. There they are again, those pesky feelings. Pat them on the head and acknowledge them. Maybe serve them a cup of tea and sit with them for awhile. They’ll leave eventually.

## What Grief Looks Like — How To Recognize It

In case you’re like me in times of stress and, instead of recognizing the little darlings you are covering your ears and eyes and shouting “La, la, la, la, la — I can’t hear you!” making them virtually unrecognizable…here are a few ways grief tends to show up for us:

- Tears. Yes, tears can show up at the most awkward times. They’re an unmistakable sign of emotion that decided to show up and does not want to leave. I think it’s understandable that, depending on your situation, tears may not show up at convenient times. Obviously, if you can shed tears, please do — they are a great and efficient way to move through deep feelings.
- Apathy. Full stop you just can’t even get off the couch to see why your son can’t get his own juice. Everything is difficult. Combing your hair? Changing into new sweatpants? Yeah, maybe tomorrow.
- Irritation. Grief can show up as irritation. Snapping at people who you otherwise would adore. Not being able to even one more minute with the social media posts. And so on.
- Fogginess. You suddenly forget why you walked into the room. Or you realize that you have stopped listening to your spouse two-thirds of the way through his morning update. And what in the world was that thing you had to do today?
  Sleep disruption. Grief can show up in vivid dreams, over sleeping or insomnia.

## Grief First Aid

Once you recognize grief and understand that it’s here, in your life, uninvited, what can you do?
Allowing grief to work it’s myriad wonders in your life takes time and, frankly, is often almost a luxury.
Depending on your life situation, you may or may not be able to cry deeply when you are moved to by a wave of grief. Apathy? When you are in survival mode and wondering how to apply for relief for your small business or trying to figure out how to work from home when your home consists of more than a few barriers to productivity? Or perhaps you are an essential worker. Can you actually indulge in apathy during a time when the world is relying on you to be our hero? I can say the same for the other ways that grief tends to show up. Irritation? Fogginess? Yeah, no, actually. We collectively don’t have time for that right now, thank you very much.
So, while the best answer to grief includes therapy, allowing a full range of feelings and emotions, finding space to cry and so on, there are going to be times where you simply cannot.
And, for those times, instead of the usual response to decide it’s “wine o’clock” or remembering that when you force a smile, you can often steel your way through nearly anything, I would like to offer some first aid for grief.
Here are a few things you might be able to do in a pinch, or attempt to work into your daily ritual, that can help you through times of grief and help to keep you feeling your feelings in a healthy way until you have the space and luxury to deeply work through them.

- Grounding. Make a basket or box of things that ground you: For example, a bucket of flax seeds that you can plunge your hands into, a lavender scented eye pillow, noise cancelling headphones, a piece of fabric that soothes you.
- Ritual. Try to work ritual into your day. This doesn’t have to be fancy, but might include a time spent reminding yourself that you are loved, that you are worthy, that you are able to move through grief. You might keep a list of things that bring you pleasure, that you are grateful for. You might try for one random act of kindness per day. Etc.
- Movement. This doesn’t have to be marathon-level. Gentle movement works wonders though. A simple yoga routine, a short walk, breathing deeply 5 times, or just a few pushups can be enough.
  ## Grief Won’t Go Away With Willpower Alone
  You might make an analogy to a broken ankle. Perhaps it’s true that you broke it stumbling over a simple crack in the sidewalk while walking your dog. It doesn’t matter. It’s still broken and won’t heal without first aid and, when you can get to a professional, prescribed treatment.
  If you’re experiencing grief from Covid-19, accept it and use first aid to help yourself through it. You’re worth it. No judgement.
