#### “I now see how owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing that we will ever do.” ~Brene Brown

How do you feel about your story? Would you feel comfortable telling a version of your story where you show up as the hero? And not some post modern dystopian anti-hero, but a solid, old-school, Joan of Arc or Lancelot kind?
I don’t know how that feels for you, but I know that for many of us, it’s not easy to see ourselves as the gorgeous hero of our “one wild and precious life”.
Luckily, an introverted researcher named Brene Brown carved out a path for us back in 2011 in the form of a TEDx Houston talk that was watched by millions. Since then, she’s opened a floodgate for us.
And in that floodgate is a ton of wisdom, but it is a floodgate, and it can feel overwhelming. We know vulnerability is the path to an empowered life of real connection where we’re the hero of our life story. But it can also feel essential to be “vulnerable” with everyone, all the time. It sometimes can feel awkward when you don’t want to get vulnerable with all your friends, neighbours, Uber drivers, and your dentist.
What’s the secret to navigating the vulnerability floodgate?
It’s all in the power of choice and a sense of authenticity.

## The Power of Choice

Brene Brown says that vulnerability has:

- uncertainty
- risk
- emotional exposure
  Yikes! Uncertain, emotionally exposed, at risk? Not a place many of us wake up hoping to get to that day…I mean, maybe with your best friend…but it can feel exhausting, raw, and frankly, terrifying when you include Uber driver, dentist, and that guy you met in line at the grocery store.
  Ah. And that’s where the power of choice comes in. Brene Brown says:
  ”Vulnerability is based on mutuality and requires boundaries and trust. It’s not oversharing, it’s not purging, it’s not indiscriminate disclosure, and it’s not celebrity-style social media information dumps. Vulnerability is about sharing our feelings and our experiences with people who have earned the right to hear them.”
  I’m not alone in feeling that we need to be reminded that true vulnerability, the kind that empowers us, requires boundaries and trust.
  Jordan Harbinger wrote a blog post called “Stop Trying to be Vulnerable Do This Instead”.
  He uses the term “authentic vulnerability” to remind us, as Brene Brown does, that true vulnerability happens on our terms, with people who have earned that right. It involves consent.
  That means that you should be able to say, “No thank you, I’d rather not share that.” and know that, in fact, by showing up authentically, you are actually being vulnerable. You are not going to use a fake “vulnerability placeholder” laden with some bullshit answer that you think people want to hear. You’re going to show up with your most authentic self, saying, “I know you want more of me, but I’m not ready yet.”

## Authenticity

I found a great article over at Psychology Today that outlines what it looks like to be authentic.
These are the seven characteristics of a truly authentic human being:

- Have realistic perceptions of reality.
- Are accepting of themselves and of other people.
- Are thoughtful.
- Have a non-hostile sense of humor.
- Are able to express their emotions freely and clearly.
- Are open to learning from their mistakes.
- Understand their motivations.
  If you find yourself struggling with any of the above seven points, pause and consider what’s going on. You most likely are not in a safe place where you can freely be vulnerable.
  And that’s okay.
  And if you share anyway, and your sharing wasn’t received well, move back into your authenticity and realize that you just got an awesome opportunity to learn from a mistake. Not everyone is ready to receive your beautiful vulnerability.
  And that’s okay, too.
  And, if someone shares something with you and you were not ready for it — yep, you got this —
  That’s still okay.
  You can let them know, gently, that you’re not ready.
  You know what? That’s why there are therapists. When you’re not ready to hold what someone needs to share with you, the ethical, correct thing to do is to refer them to someone who is.
  Authentic Vulnerability
  Finding a good therapist is a pretty good idea if you decide to go down this path for any length of time.
  A good therapist who will hold your hand through your learning, hold your boundaries firm but in a stance that’s willing to flex them as people around you begin to do their work and show up for you.
  It’s an incredibly deep, worthwhile journey. You will get hurt. You will. But you’ll keep growing and showing up.
  And as you develop your resilience, you get that much stronger, more willing to take chances on relationships, on humans, on life.
  It’s a journey of a lifetime and it is so worthwhile.
  I’m dedicating 2020 to uncovering our vulnerable underbellies and getting to a place where we are all tough as nails and ready for the most authentic, vulnerable, wild and precious life possible.
  Join me, won’t you? I’m starting with a simple newsletter called “10 Things”. It’s not a cure, but a start. I send 10 Things each Monday — a careful curation of quotes, quests, songs, and videos that might gently open your heart and help you grow more authentically vulnerable.
  “10 Things” is the newsletter for The Underbelly.
