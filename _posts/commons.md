## The Marathon of Creative Process

The social economy(particularly in its informal manifestations)seems as good a place as any to seek out such spaces of possibility, where concerns for solidarity, participation, service, and community building are asimportant, if not moreimportant, than profit or revenue generation

commodification and decommodification

food

urban commons

self-organized collective action is what characterizes the commons as a realm beyond both market and state

collectivity vs gardens

community orchards as experiments in reclaiming thecommons

Consequently, it is helpful to think of commons as relationsmore than thing

A decommodified space is therefore one in which goods, services, ideas and people (through their labour) are not exchanged for money (if they are exchanged at all), but instead are freely given

It is this idea of the gift that provides a tangible counterpoint to the commodity.

The Gift, counter-posed the selflessness of creative works to the culture of capitalism

the difference between a gift and a commodity is profound. The gift is offered freely, with no expectation of return to the giver; it functions to establish a feeling-bond between people. Gifts function as covenants, symbolizing an understanding and a desire regarding relationship. This is most evident in gifts of incorporation (as in wedding rings), gifts of peace (to abolish division), and gifts of atonement (to re-establish broken bonds). Sometimes gift exchange is circular, meaning that the giver gives to someone from whom they will not receive, though they will eventually receive from someone else. In large groups, gifts act not so much to consolidate bonds of affection between individuals as to constitute and affirm group membership—to make one body out of many

“we do not deal in commodities when we wish to initiate or preserve ties of affection”

For these reasons, when a thing—be it fruit, labour, service, or idea—is not bought but received; not sold but given, theconsequences can be profound

We "own" it in that we'reresponsible to it, but not in that we get to sell it.

Thus, the concept of the gift has the potential to profoundly challenge deep-seated notions of scarcityin capitalist societies.

3 things wrong

Of course, it is a privilege to be able to chooseto give freely of one’s time; not everyone can do that. As Allen points out, “those with the greatest need often have the least ability to exercise individual choice” precisely because “allocations of choices are shaped by the historical demographics of inequality”

From these quotes, it seems that it is not obligationper se that people chafe at, but imposition. In a gift economy, the obligation to give, and to reciprocate, is understood and accepted. When people feel an obligation to the orchard and to each other that arises from within, it compels them to give in ways they typically feel good about. But when the shape, form, timing, quantity, or value of the gift is externally dictated, or seems to come from “above”, people will tend to resist.

Most of the time, members are entrusted to be self-monitoring and to do their part with little, if any, external verification. That is not to say that it always works, just that autonomy and self-direction (with loose oversight) seems to bring out the greatest commitment and initiative in members.

Economists call it the “crowding-out effect” whereby intrinsic motivations are crowded out by external rewards

autonomy, non-coercion, and the sense of belonging that generates an intrinsic felt obligation to accept and to keep the gift in motion. It is an ethos that reflects very different conceptions of scarcity and abundance. Hyde quotes
