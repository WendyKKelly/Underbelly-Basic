description: 'How do you feel about your story? Would you feel comfortable telling a version of your story where you show up as the hero? And not some post modern dystopian anti-hero, but a solid, old-school, Joan of Arc or Lancelot kind?
I don’t know how that feels for you, but I know that for many of us, it’s not easy to see ourselves as the gorgeous hero of our “one wild and precious life”.'

#### “I believe that we who care about addiction must continue the heroic rescue work, but I also believe that the even more, absolutely essential task is getting rid of “the-son of-a-bitch upstream,” that is, the psychological toxicity that dislocates so many people in the world of late modernity." - Dr. Bruce Alexander, existential psychologist

I began contemplating connectedness a few weeks ago. If you want to be emotionally strong and flexible, if you want to truly embrace your whole self, you need connection.

You need connection and meaning in a culture that makes sense to you.

And, I'm willing to bet that for many, that's just not a the case. Here's what I think may be happening:

## We Crave Culture

We need culture. We need bonds to our community. We need these so desperately that without them, we turn quickly and religiously to addictions to things that might help us feel connected. That might help us feel like our lives have meaning.

We get the dopamine hits and oxytocin floods that we so desperately need.

And, for awhile, all is right within us and within our families and within our communities as we bask in these feelings.

Of course, since all is not right with the world, with ourselves, with our families, with our communities, as soon as the feeling is gone and we find ourselves smack dab in front of all that is wrong — and without a strong healthy culture to help us find real connection and real meaning, we're basically screwed.

[I just finished a great article by Bruce K. Alexander,](https://brucekalexander.com/articles-speeches/newest-articles-speeches/creating-healing-communities-in-a-toxic-society) the Vancouver existential psychologist who is famous for his "rat park" experiments. These are the set of experiments he did at Simon Fraser University where he showed that actually, cocaine and other drugs are not the preferred choice of rats when they are in an "enriched" environment. When rats have access to other rats they like, to good food, to toys, etc, they prefer those healthy choices rather than the cocaine. They do not overdose. They do not kill themselves from the drugs, as they tend to do when isolated in a cage with the simple choice of water or cocaine.

We're a lot like rats in some ways. We really need healthy culture and meaning in our lives. If all we have is watered down pablum, if what we have is actually toxic and hurtful, we tend to turn to drugs.

And when we avoid drugs for whatever reason we turn to other pursuits like gambling, wealth, sex, power, social media, video games, shopping, hoarding, etc.

Honestly, you either have an addiction or you are lying. Probably. (I'm being a bit confrontational because I do believe many of us like to think we're all good because we're not like So and So who, you know, has a _real_ problem.)

## What We Need is Healthy Culture

We need healthy culture. It's hard to even describe what that might look like, and certainly, it can take many different shapes. But at a minimum, humans need access to play, access to beauty, access to fresh air and healthy water and food. We need shelter that is consistent and clean-ish.

In a healthy culture, we have enough safety and security along with friendship. We enjoy respect and a certain amount of autonomy. It doesn't have to be perfect.

Many of us live lives in a culture that is far from healthy. That's just modern life, really. Again, I am being confrontational because I truly feel that many of us hide behind shiny things to try to prove to ourselves and others that we're healthy. It's not us! It's So and So, over there, whose life is unhealthy...

## What Can We Do? Individual Responsibility

Bruce K Alexander in the speech I read (and quoted, above) calls out the work of [Jordan Peterson](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/) and many of the positive things he has added to psychology over the years. I tend to agree.

One of the cool things he had the guts to talk about is that old fashioned idea of personal responsibility. I think it's time to add it back in to our culture.

For all the importance of harm reduction and recovery, it's also true that without personal responsibility, we end up with problems. Don't get me wrong, we need the compassion and the work of harm reduction and recovery. But it's time to add back in a dose of personal responsibility.

Here's why I think it's vital: Without it, people can begin to feel that they are powerless against Culture. Capital C Culture. A Culture that they have no say in, in a life that they have no agency in.

When our lives become passive in that way, we take in Culture but add nothing to it. We are flotsam. We float along, in a meaningless impotent way.

And that is a huge lie.

## We Can (and must) Create Our Culture

We can't, of course, do this on our own. Remember the rats in Rat Park? What happens when we do it all on our own? Yeah, it doesn't end well. Personal responsibility without being part of an empathetic, caring community that lifts you up when you need lifting — and where you lift others up when you're strong and they need lifting — that kind of personal responsibility is a lonely path.

However, and hey, just putting this out there in case it strikes you as a good idea...

If we do our work, if we grow and get strong and do what we need to do so that we can join others who are also in this arena, on this path, engaging in a co-created culture — if we choose to take responsibility for what is ours, for what we can do, and then look up for a bit into the eyes of our neighbour and join them...

Yes, I am hopeful for the future. Yes, I am going to add my tiny drop of what I can into this large bucket of our collective culture. Join me?
