#### “And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.” — Anias Nin

Bloom where you are planted. One of my standbys. I have a dear friend who lives in NYC. Like, in the city. Before that, she lived in Los Angeles. Before that, Cape Town.

During that same time, I lived in Nelson, the small town of 10,000 where I live now. Before that, I lived in Pemberton (10 times smaller). Before that, I lived in Whistler (small, too).

When we met as teenagers, pretty much the only thing we knew is that she needed to always live in a small town and I craved cities. The idea of a small town made me feel like I was suffocating. How could I grow in a small town? And a rural small town in the middle of nowhere? No, thank you.

She said it first. We were catching up at one point, and I mentioned the oddity that she'd become a city person whereas I seemed destined to always live in a small town.

"We bloom where we're planted," she said.

## We Bloom Where We Are Planted

Beyond city vs country, these days, it sometimes feels as though our environment shifts beneath us as we move through our days.

I have been watching my husband and sons remain poised as they consider, sometimes more than once per day, whether they will have a job in a week, where they will live next month, where their school will be, if there will be a school, etc.

I know they are not alone.

How do you bloom when you are planted in quicksand?

tl;dr — Start with your breath.

## Breathe

If you are feeling like you've been planted in quicksand, start with your breath. First thing, any time you feel uncertain, anxious, stressed, or off kilter, stop and breathe deeply five times.

You don't have to get into "hero's pose" or lie down in a quiet room. You don't have to light a candle or press your hands together.

You can quietly, subtly, easily breathe where you are.

The more often you practice deep breathing when you need a reset, the easier it gets and the more normal it becomes.

You're doing a few things at once when you breathe:

1. You literally tone your vagus nerve by deep breathing. Your vagus nerve controls your parasympathetic nervous system
2. You gently remind yourself of your agency. You can choose to slow down. As you breathe in, hold, breathe out slowly, you notice that the world continues, nothing implodes, life goes on.
3. You reset gratitude. You are breathing. You are alive.

## Sunshine

You don't want to stuff down the bad that does exist, but a key to growing where you are planted is teaching yourself, much as a plant does, to turn toward the sun.

Persistently notice the sun in your life. Notice the things that help you grow. Notice the nurturing stuff that exists in your life. Grow toward it.

A whole whack of unpleasant things may be true in your life. Acknowledge them, sure, and then turn toward the sun.

Sunshine is direct, honest, and forthright. Turning toward sunshine requires gratitude — start with your breath if you feel like there's no sunshine in your life.

If you stay with breathing as your only source of sunlight while gently acknowledging the dark stuff but not focusing on it, slowly, slowly, you'll turn more firmly to the sun.

I can't promise anything miraculous, but I am willing to bet that over time, as you turn toward the sun while gently acknowledging the dark stuff, you'll begin to notice more positive lightness in your life.

Often, these things appear almost like stepping stones in the mist. One by one, you'll notice a quiet, supportive friend. Or a time of day where everything seems more peaceful. Perhaps it's a compliment that strikes you as spot on and a great reminder that what you love doing is something the world needs more of.

Who knows what your sunshine looks like or where it will fall.

I do know that it will feel stable, calm, solid, and intentional.

## Compost

If you are in quicksand, it may be quite possible that you can and should feed your soil.

Quick caveat: Look, I'm not a real gardener. I honestly know nothing about what you should really do if you really want to grow while planted in quicksand.

But there's a gardening concept that feels like it might be an excellent fit for how to explain this next concept:

When you have poor soil, you can and should add rich compost (or, I guess, fertilizer if you're a more conventional gardener) to your soil to improve it.

You can do the same thing in your life if you find yourself planted somewhere unstable.

Good soil — the medium you are growing in — can be ameliorated.

Now, here's where it gets interesting: your soil, what you need to grow, is something only you really know. It's weird how often leaders, experts, gurus, and others want to be prescriptive and give you a concrete list of things you need.

Sure, I suppose it feels good to get that list. And absolutely, it can feel like sweet relief, especially when you are swimming in quicksand.

And, honestly, as a first aid treatment, it's easy to find solace in a "do this, not that" directive.

When you're ready, though, once you've calmed yourself —

Remind yourself that you know what you need. You know how to feed yourself. And by the way, that means feeding yourself both literally and figuratively.

## Learning About Your Soil

I've struggled a lot over the years with not feeling good enough and definitely with questioning my decisions. Constant second guessing. Constant listening to "helpful advice".

I can tell you this: Not once in my entire history did someone else know more or know better about me than me. Certainly, I have listened to advice and incorporated sound wisdom into my core philosophy.

But the stronger I become in my core, the easier it becomes to stand up straight and make very good decisions for myself.

And the result is a way healthier family, way healthier marriage, way healthier friendships. A healthier self.

Again, I am not advocating for never listening to anyone ever. I am advocating for knowing that you know yourself best. Learning how to get still so that you can access that wisdom is essential.

## Blooming in Good Soil Requires Suffering?

So - Another bit of gardening knowledge that I am going to mangle for my own personal metaphor growth:

_Flowers bloom when stressed._

I will not say that you must suffer in order to bloom. What I will say is that yes, you do require constraints.

Do the constraints need to be painful? No they do not.

Are they sometimes? Yes, yes they are.

Do you get to choose? Sometimes, yes, you can. Often this requires self discipline and planning. It also requires a bit of luck, which often, research shows, you need to be ready to recognize.

I love the ideas of constraints, luck, and optimism — so I will definitely be writing and speaking about these concepts some more later on in the fall.

Right now, know that you can make small changes to your surroundings, to your environment that help you bloom right where you're planted.

## To Bloom Where You are Planted, Become Your Own Gardener

Tend to your own environment. Cultivate your soil. Turn toward your sun. Find the necessary constraints to help yourself bloom.

And then join all the other beautiful humans blooming around you. You know, you may just inspire someone to turn toward their sun and the world may get just that much brighter and more beautiful.

Excuse the sappy ending — this gardening metaphor is never ending :)

Thanks for reading. I appreciate you, you lovely blossom.
