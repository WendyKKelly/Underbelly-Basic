#### “I now see how owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing that we will ever do.” ~Brene Brown

My cousins and my sister and I just finished recording a podcast episode for Wild and Precious Conversations.

I'm spent. We spent time yesterday hashing out parameters, what we wanted from the conversation, what we should talk about, what we shouldn't.
We were nervous. Or at least, I was. I have interviewed a lot of people over the years, and I always come to the table as an amateur, curious, open to whatever happens. I honestly am not usually nervous.
And this time I was. There are a few ways to frame why I was nervous. I wanted to be true to our family's story. I needed an authenticity, a vulnerability or it wouldn't work. We absolutely could not use sentimentality.

## Vulnerability

Brene Brown says that vulnerability has:

- uncertainty
- risk
- emotional exposure

  I wrote in a previous blog post that "true vulnerability happens on our terms, with people who have earned that right. It involves consent.
  That means that you should be able to say, “No thank you, I’d rather not share that.” and know that, in fact, by showing up authentically, you are actually being vulnerable. You are not going to use a fake “vulnerability placeholder” laden with some bullshit answer that you think people want to hear. You’re going to show up with your most authentic self, saying, “I know you want more of me, but I’m not ready yet.” "

  The question was, "would this work in an unscripted conversation with my family?"

## Authenticity

Here is what authenticity looks like:

- Have realistic perceptions of reality.
- Are accepting of themselves and of other people.
- Are thoughtful.
- Have a non-hostile sense of humor.
- Are able to express their emotions freely and clearly.
- Are open to learning from their mistakes.
- Understand their motivations.

## The Strength of Authentic Vulnerability

We did it. We laughed, we went to places we had never talked about before, we contemplated why it is that we are still friends and super close. We touched on the eccentricity in our family and I learned how much of our familiy's nuttiness I ported forward into raising my own four sons.

I want a world not where every family looks the same. I don't want a world (God help us!) where everyone uses my proven techniques to achieve a happy family. I want a world where we aren't striving for happy families. I want healthy families.

## Healthy Families Flex and Grow

Our family, for multiple generations, has stayed remarkably close despite differences. I'm the only one in my generation who is heterosexual in a traditional marriage with four biological kids.

On paper, I have nothing in common with my family, and according to what stands in for culture in our society (i.e. mass media) we shouldn't get along. On the contrary, we're extremely close.

I know I am not alone. I see healthy families all around me. They're each healthy in their own nutty, human way. You can tell a healthy family by it's willingness to grow. By it's care — a great example of this care was the time we spent, the four of us, making sure that we would be both authentic and vulnerable but also honoring to members of the family who wouldn't be in the (zoom) room with us.

I'm really looking forward to creating this episode. Yes, there are a few things I am editing out. Things we touched on that really, are none of y'alls business. But most stuff we're leaving in. It's a bit raw, funny, and very very real.

Why do I think it's going to make a good podcast episode? No, we're not the Kardashians, but listening to a healthy family talk openly about how we realized that yes, actually, our functionally dysfunctional, perfectly imperfect family is super healthy is a rare treat. Join us on Thursday.
