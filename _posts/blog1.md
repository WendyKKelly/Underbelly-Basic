“When we lose our tolerance to be vulnerable, joy becomes foreboding.” ― Brene Brown, Daring Greatly
What an odd week to choose joy as my topic.
On Tuesday, I wrote about joy being a posture, not a feeling. Three days later, we are now officially in a pandemic. Wow. This week feels like APJoy and I didn’t study.
Brene Brown says in an interview with Oprah that “Joy is terrifying”.
Facing joy this week as we collectively come to terms with the Coronavirus (COVID-19)? Hearing Brene Brown talk to Oprah about how terrifying joy is gave me that epiphany I needed to realize that, heck yes, now is exactly the time to talk about joy.
Because (and Brene Brown concurs) in the best of times, many of us hip check our chances for joy and send them flying into the boards before those brief glimpses of joy get too real for us.
Brene Brown’s example is perfect: A quiet, peaceful moment when your gaze falls adoringly on someone you love — and your thoughts go straight to “what if” — They could get sick and die. They could get into a car crash. They could fall in their next ski competition. We deftly sweep our minds away from the moment.
Unless we have been training, because living a vulnerable, authentic, courageous life takes training — we cannot hold that gaze. We quickly steel ourselves and return to “real life”. Maybe we check their forehead for a fever, and, relieved, return to the kitchen to finish the dishes.

“It doesn’t happen all at once,’ said the Skin Horse. ‘You become. It takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are Real you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.” ― Margery Williams Bianco, The Velveteen Rabbit
##Training For Joy
So here we are: Many of us have had to take measures including social distancing and hopefully all of us are doing what we need to do to help our communities stay healthy and well.
It’s also an excellent time to train for joy.
One way to train for joy is to practice gratitude. Brene Brown recommends it, but the first time I remember hearing about the concept was from Sarah Ban Breathnach and her “Simple Abundance” daily journal.
I would like to propose a training regimen, starting now, to increase our capacity for joy. So we’re ready. So we can begin to become “real”. So we can get strong enough to hold the gaze of a loved one — even while they are awake (!) So we can feel joy even when things get tough.
In my last post, I listed the feelings created by joy. Here they are again:
-pleasure
-amusement
-contentment
-excitement
-relief
-wonder
-ecstasy
-bliss
-exultation
-elevation
-gratitude
All you need to do is notice the above feelings and write down (or otherwise record) what elicited that feeling. Keep a little book with you. Take a picture with your silly phone. Tell someone — oral storytelling counts.
Consider keeping that list of emotions with you at all times so you can, detective-like, suss them out.
For the love of all that is dear please do not worry or care if you do it daily, weekly or hourly. Just begin to notice. The idea is that, over time, you practice a thing called aversion therapy. Think about it: we are terrified of joy. We feel foreboding when joy approaches. We need to build up tolerance to joy.
We need to do this now. We have everything we need to begin the training. And the benefits are enormous.
