## Podcasts: What They Are

If you are one of the 62% of Americans, or 72% of Canadians who didn't listen to a podcast this month, but you're curious about them, you're in the right place.

Podcasts have been deemed "the new radio" â€” Certainly, they're an audio format. And, like radio, there's a range of styles and formats that is actually pretty similar to radio. There are heavily produced series from NPR, the CBC and others where each season may have been written/produced and created months before you listen to it. There are others that are produced weekly, and while a few might be "batch produced" they are often done a week at a time as close to the time you listen as possible. These will often be timely, or at least mention something happening "in real time" as you listen. These are also less heavily produced, as you might expect.

If you'd like to listen to podcasts, you first need a podcast player. Our smartphones have really helped us listen to podcasts.

If you have an iPhone, you'll have Apple Podcasts built in. Another couple that are for iPhone users include Overcast and Pocket Casts. Both are considered _amazing_.

If you have an Android (that's pretty much everyone else) then you'll have Google Podcasts available.

And then there are the options for all of us. The arena is opening up, with some players creating exclusive deals with big celebrities. Joe Rogan just made a deal with Spotify, for example. And I have a paid subscription to Luminary so that I can listen to Trevor Noah's podcast there. Each player has it's pros and slight irritations. There's no reason you have to chose one, either. Try a few and see what works best for you.

- Luminary
- Spotify
- Stitcher
- iHeart Radio

Most podcasts can be found on all (or most) players. Wild and Precious Conversations can be found everywhere I have thought to look, though occasionally I have to type in the entire title. I changed the name of the podcast, too (it used to by called The Underbelly, but I didn't think that fit very well.) Changing the name made it a little more challenging to find. But we're there!

Once you have found a few podcasts you like, subscribe to them. That way, each new episode will be downloaded to your phone on its release. Some players let you make your own playlists, so that you can chose episodes from a few different podcasts that you like. I love that idea!

And, of course, if you like a podcast, make sure you rate and review it. That is an excellent way to let the podcast producer know you're out there. Not every player has a way to rate and review, and iTunes/Apple podcasts is the most well known.

What should you listen to? And how can you find new shows? Honestly, I wish I had a better answer, but word of mouth has been the best way for me to find new podcasts to listen to. Share the ones you like, and ask your friends what they listen to.

My list of podcasts I regularly listen to?

- My Favorite Murder
